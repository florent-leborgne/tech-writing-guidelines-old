These guidelines are intended for web developers, designers and content authors. This is a
list of common tips and tricks on accessibility; it is not exhaustive and does not replace
the official standards. In general, we follow the
[WCAG 2.0 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#guidelines).

Accessibility is a broad topic. Content is only a part of it. Check the
[EUI documentation](https://eui.elastic.co/#/guidelines/accessibility) for more general
accessibility guidelines.

## Writing for accessibility

### Alt text

Alt text is **mandatory** for all **images, audios, or videos**.

Make sure that concepts and tasks are as clear as possible even without any media. To
enable content for screen readers or Braille output devices, use ALT text to describe the
media. ALT text is supported by most document formats, including HTML, Microsoft Word, and
Adobe PDF.

**Do**

- Be concise and accurate.
- If an image contains text, repeat that text in the description.
- If the media has been used as a link, describe the link destination.
- If an image is for decorative purposes, describe it as “decorative”.
- For audios and videos, add captions and create scripts that describe the visual content.
  Provide the script as a separate description track, either as timed text or recorded
  narration. There are many free, easy-to-use tools available that support the process of
  transcribing and captioning videos. For more information, refer to
  [Creating Accessible Videos](https://www.washington.edu/accessibility/videos/).

**Examples**

For example, in HTML:

```html
<img src="signup.png" alt="Signup page for Elastic Cloud" />
```

**Don't**

- Do not use special characters such as backticks (`) in alt text. They are known to cause
  formatting issues when building pages.

### Use meaningful links

**General rule**

Avoid "here", "Read more", "Learn more", or anything that doesn't describe what to expect
behind as link text. The link should clearly describe what the URL is about. Screen
readers jump between links by generating a list of them. Unless they are accompanied by a
descriptive tooltip, hearing a list of “Click here" links is not helpful. Linked text
should be concise and descriptive.

Avoid raw URLs (https://website.com/page), because screen readers move through a document
like a cursor and vocalize every single letter.

- **Don't**: Click [here](https://www.elastic.co/support/welcome) to open a support case.
- **Do**: Go to [Working with Elastic Support](https://www.elastic.co/support/welcome) to
  open a support case.

**Calls to action (CTA)**

If a link is a CTA, accept shorter descriptions, such as “Download report”. It's OK to use
“Read more” or “Learn more” if used as CTA for introductory content.

**Download links**

If a link is a download, include details about the document name, type, and file size
whenever possible; for example, “Download text description of the 'Access and Inclusion is
Good for Business' video (Word, 165KB)”.

### Use unique headings

Screen readers recognize and announce the heading levels in the order in which they
appear, and cannot identify headings if they are solely distinguished by visual cues such
as different fonts.

- Headings should read as statements that can stand alone and be understood independently
  from other headings or sections of the page.
- Use concise and descriptive titles that are relevant to the goals and audience of the
  content.
- Don't write headings as interrupted sentences that continue in the body text. Also,
  avoid writing headings as incomplete statements that “flow” from one heading to the
  next. This can make the flow of the text unclear for users who are using screen readers.
- Break down blocks of information, and make it easier to revisit a certain topic.
- Structure headings from H1 to H3.

### Structure your content well

- Left-align text to avoid uneven spacing between letters and words.
- Use paragraphs and lists to group information, provide orientation, and improve
  readability. Lists can be ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted).
- Tag tables correctly:
  - Header cells marked with \<th\>
  - Data cells marked with \<td\>
- Tables should always have a title. Code blocks don't need to.
- Consider how your information will be displayed on various mobile devices.

### Improve readability

**Do**

- Use clear, simple language.
- Expand acronyms.
- Use clean typography.
- Provide the right amount of space between lines of text.

**Don't**

- Avoid jargon, metaphors, and Latin abbreviations.
- Limit the use of bold and never underline text. Reserve underlining for identifying
  links.
- Avoid changing the typeface from that specified by the website.
- Avoid using all caps. Readability is reduced with all caps because all words have a
  uniform rectangular shape, meaning readers can't identify words by their shape.
- Support text resizing.

### Rethink some terminology

- Avoid terms that include actions: click, tap, press, see .Try replacing them with:
  choose, select, check.
- Avoid terms that indicate directions: above, below, left, right, beside. Try rewording
  the text based on the context:
  - Don't: "Update your index mapping as you can see below to get the full benefit of
    aggregating and searching for feature importance."
  - Do: "To benefit from aggregating and searching for feature importance, update your
    index mapping as shown in this code example: [code example]"
- Avoid sight- or hearing-related language (see more, hear about, etc.), especially in
  headings.

## Testing content for accessibility

### When?

Test early, test often. Accessibility evaluations should start right at the beginning of
product design and be included in subsequent development iterations through to final
delivery.

### How?

**Navigate a website or app with only a keyboard** to ensure all content is accessible and
that a skip navigation link exists.

**Test pages on mobile devices.** A growing number of users, including users with
disabilities, are accessing the web using phones, tablets, and other mobile devices. Test
your website using mobile devices, and when doing so, be sure to check for accessibility.

**Try a screen reader** to understand how users navigate websites using one of the screen
reader/browser combinations listed in the

<DocLink
  id="accessibility"
  section="assistive-technologies"
  text="Assistive technologies"
/> section.

**Turn off speakers and microphones** to make sure the website experience is the same with
or without sound.

### Assistive technologies

Assistive technology provides the opportunity for individuals with disabilities to access
information technology and perform functions that might be otherwise impossible, like
reading text, navigating websites, or listening to a video.

[Text-to-speech and screen readers](https://libguides.reading.ac.uk/inclusive-technology/text-to-speech)
read what's on your screen through the semantics placed in the content by developers.

[Screen magnification software](https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/using-computer/part-ii-experienced-computer-user-new-0)
is used to enlarge the monitor and make reading easy for vision-impaired users.

[The #NoMouse challenge](http://nomouse.org) provides guidance on how to navigate a
website by using only the keyboard. Also check out
[this list of special keyboards](https://bltt.org/keyboards-for-disabled-people/) made for
users who have motor control difficulties.

### Accessibility testing with automation

Automated testing is a great way to start weaving accessibility into your website, with
the ultimate goal of shifting more and more towards the UX and discovery process. These
are some of the many open source accessibility tools:

- [NV Access](https://www.nvaccess.org/)
- [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)
- [axe™ - The Standard in Accessibility Testing](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
- [Pa11y - automated accessibility testing pal](https://pa11y.org)
